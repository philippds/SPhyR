    "prompt": "You are given a structural material distribution represented as a grid. Each cell can have one of the following states:\n- 'L' indicates applied load.\n- 'V' indicates void.\n- 'S' indicates support.\n\nThe goal is to predict the correct material distribution by filling in all 'V' cells with either '1' (solid) or '0' (empty), based on the surrounding structure and implicit physical reasoning (such as load paths, supports, and forces).\n\nRelevant physical knowledge for reasoning:\n- Loads ('L') create forces that must be transferred through continuous material paths to supports ('S').\n- Stress follows the shortest stiff path from loads to supports.\n- Any material cell that is disconnected from both loads and supports does not carry force and should be avoided.\n- Structures should satisfy equilibrium: all loads must eventually be resisted by at least one support.\n- Use as little material as possible while still maintaining at least one valid load path.\n\nBelow is the input grid with masked regions:\n\n0 L L L L L 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 V 0 0 V V 0\n0 0 0 1 V 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 V 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 V 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 V V 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 V 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 S S V S S\n\nPlease output the completed grid by replacing all 'V' cells with either '1' (solid) or '0' (empty).\nMaintain the same format as the input: one row per line, cells separated by spaces, and the total number of rows and columns unchanged.\nReturn only the completed grid without any additional explanation.",
