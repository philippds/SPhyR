    "prompt": "You are given a structural material distribution represented as a grid. Each cell can have one of the following states:\n- 'L' indicates applied load.\n- 'V' indicates void.\n- 'S' indicates support.\n\nThe goal is to predict the correct material distribution by filling in all 'V' cells with either '1' (solid) or '0' (empty), based on the surrounding structure and implicit physical reasoning (such as load paths, supports, and forces).\n\nImportant: The completed structure should use as little material as possible while remaining stable and plausible for carrying the applied forces.
