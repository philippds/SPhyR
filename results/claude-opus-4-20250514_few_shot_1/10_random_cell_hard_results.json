Each cell can have one of the following states:\n- 'L' indicates applied load.\n- 'V' indicates void.\n- 'S' indicates support.\n\nThe goal is to predict the correct material distribution by filling in all 'V' cells with a floating point number between 0 and 1, with one decimal place (e.g., 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0), based on the surrounding structure and implicit physical reasoning (such as load paths, supports, and forces).\n\nExample input grid with masked regions:\n\n0.0 0.0 L L L L L V 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.5 V 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 V 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 V 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 V\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 V 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 V 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.1 V 0.0\n0.0 0.0 V 0.0 0.0 S S S S 0.0\n\nCorresponding completed output grid:\n\n0.0 0.0 L L L L L 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.3 0.5 0.3 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.6 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.1 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 S S S S 0.0\n\nImportant: The completed structure should use as little material as possible while remaining stable and plausible for carrying the applied forces.
