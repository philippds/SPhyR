This means the load cells and supports should be connected by a minimal solid vertical \"column\" of '1's along the first column for loads and along the last column for supports. The rest can be left as empty ('0') to minimize material usage. Since the leftmost column has loads, it should be solid (1) vertically to transfer load down. Similarly, the rightmost column supporting the loads should also be solid (1). The bottom row and left and right boundaries at the supports and loads must be solid too for stability.
