Each cell can have one of the following states:\n- 'L' indicates applied load.\n- 'V' indicates void.\n- 'S' indicates support.\n\nThe goal is to predict the correct material distribution by filling in all 'V' cells with a floating point number between 0 and 1, with one decimal place (e.g., 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1.0), based on the surrounding structure and implicit physical reasoning (such as load paths, supports, and forces).\n\nImportant: The completed structure should use as little material as possible while remaining stable and plausible for carrying the applied forces.
