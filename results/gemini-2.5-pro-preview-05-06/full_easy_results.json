So, for row 1 (the first 'V' row), cells in columns 1, 2, 3, 4 will be '1'.\n    *   Material must exist directly above the supports. So, for row 8 (the last 'V' row), cells in columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 will be '1'.\n\n3.  **Interpolate Material Path:**\n    We can model the structure as a solid beam connecting the load region to the support region. The beam's edges will be determined by linearly interpolating between the extremities of the material at row 1 and row 8.\n    *   Leftmost point of material at row 1 is column 1. Leftmost point at row 8 is column 3.\n    *   Rightmost point of material at row 1 is column 4.

We want to use minimal material, but also ensure all supports are engaged, especially since the load application area (columns 5-7) is not perfectly aligned with the center of the support area (columns 4-7, centered at 5.5; load centered at 6). This slight eccentricity suggests that support (9,4) should be engaged.\n\n3.  **Define the Extent of the Structure:**\n    The structure will span from row 0 (loads) to row 9 (supports).\n    Horizontally, the load is from column 5 to 7.\n    Horizontally, the support is from column 4 to 7.\n    A common approach for such problems is to define a convex hull or a filled polygon connecting the extremities of the load and support areas.\n    The \"top\" boundary of our material is effectively defined by L-cells: (0,5), (0,6), (0,7).\n    The \"bottom\" boundary by S-cells: (9,4), (9,5), (9,6), (9,7).\n\n    Let's define the material region by connecting these corners:\n    Top-left of load region: (0,5)\n    Top-right of load region: (0,7)\n    Bottom-left of support region: (9,4)\n    Bottom-right of support region: (9,7)\n\n    The material will fill the V-cells within the polygon (inclusive of boundaries) formed by these points.\n    The right boundary is a vertical line from (0,7) to (9,7) (i.e., column 7).\n    The left boundary is a line from (0,5) to (9,4).\n\n4.  **Determine the Left Boundary for each row (r):**\n    The line connects (r1,c1)=(0,5) and (r2,c2)=(9,4).\n    The column `c` for a given row `r` on this line is `c = c1 + (r - r1) * (c2 - c1) / (r2 - r1)`.\n    `c = 5 + (r - 0) * (4 - 5) / (9 - 0) = 5 + r * (-1) / 9 = 5 - r/9`.\n    We need to determine which cells are part of this boundary. Using rounding for cell centers or a line rasterization algorithm (like Bresenham's):\n    -   For r=0: c = 5. Leftmost material at (0,5).\n    -   For r=1: c = 5 - 1/9 \u2248 4.89. `round(4.89) = 5`. Leftmost V-cell to fill: (1,5).\n    -   For r=2: c = 5 - 2/9 \u2248 4.78. `round(4.78) = 5`. Leftmost V-cell to fill: (2,5).\n    -   For r=3: c = 5 - 3/9 \u2248 4.67. `round(4.67) = 5`. Leftmost V-cell to fill: (3,5).\n    -   For r=4: c = 5 - 4/9 \u2248 4.56. `round(4.56) = 5`. Leftmost V-cell to fill: (4,5).\n    -   For r=5: c = 5 - 5/9 \u2248 4.44. `round(4.44) = 4`. Leftmost V-cell to fill: (5,4).\n    -   For r=6: c = 5 - 6/9 \u2248 4.33. `round(4.33) = 4`. Leftmost V-cell to fill: (6,4).\n    -   For r=7: c = 5 - 7/9 \u2248 4.22. `round(4.22) = 4`. Leftmost V-cell to fill: (7,4).\n    -   For r=8: c = 5 - 8/9 \u2248 4.11. `round(4.11) = 4`. Leftmost V-cell to fill: (8,4).\n    -   For r=9: c = 5 - 9/9 = 4. Leftmost material at (9,4).\n\n5.  **Construct the Grid:**\n    -   Row 0: Original 'L's become '1'. `0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0`\n    -   Rows 1-4 (V-rows): Material from column 5 to 7.\n        -   `0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0`\n    -   Rows 5-8 (V-rows): Material from column 4 to 7.\n        -   `0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0`\n    -   Row 9: Original 'S's become '1'. `0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0`\n\n    This structure forms a trapezoidal shape, wider at the base, which is physically plausible for distributing load to all supports. It uses less material than a full rectangle covering columns 4-7 for all V-rows, aligning with \"minimize material usage unless necessary\". The necessity here is to engage all supports and provide a stable load path for the slightly eccentric load.\n\nFinal Grid:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0\n```",

    "completion": "The problem asks us to fill a grid representing a structural material distribution. 'L' cells are loads, 'S' cells are supports, and 'V' cells (voids) must be filled with '1' (solid material) or '0' (empty). The goal is to create a stable, plausible structure that uses minimal material to transfer loads to supports.\n\nInput Grid:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 L L L\nRow 1: V V V V V V V V V V\nRow 2: V V V V V V V V V V\nRow 3: V V V V V V V V V V\nRow 4: V V V V V V V V V V\nRow 5: V V V V V V V V V V\nRow 6: V V V V V V V V V V\nRow 7: V V V V V V V V V V\nRow 8: V V V V V V V V V V\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 S S S 0\n\nLoad details:\n- Cells (0,7), (0,8), (0,9) are 'L'. This is a 3-cell wide load at the top right.\n\nSupport details:\n- Cells (9,6), (9,7), (9,8) are 'S'. This is a 3-cell wide support at the bottom, slightly to the left of the load.\n\nStructural Goal:\nTransfer the load from LLL at row 0 (columns 7,8,9) to SSS at row 9 (columns 6,7,8).\nThe structure should be \"stable and plausible\" and \"use as little material as possible\".\n\nReasoning for the chosen structure (a \"dogbone\" or \"bottleneck\" structure):\n1.  **Load Collection:** The three load points L(0,7), L(0,8), L(0,9) need to be supported. We place material directly underneath them in row 1: (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) become '1'. This ensures each load point is immediately supported.\n2.  **Load Concentration:** To minimize material, these three points of support in row 1 will transfer their load to a narrower central strut.\n    -   (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) all transfer their load to cell (2,8). This is achieved by direct vertical connection from (1,8) to (2,8) and diagonal connections from (1,7) to (2,8) and (1,9) to (2,8). These connections are implicit; we only define cell (2,8) as '1'.\n3.  **Central Strut:** A single-cell wide strut will carry the concentrated load downwards. The path of this strut needs to account for the offset between the load centroid (approx. col 8) and support centroid (approx. col 7).\n    -   The strut starts at (2,8).\n    -   The ideal path from load centroid (0,8) to support centroid (9,7) is a line: `col = 8 - row/9`.\n    -   For row 2: `col = 8 - 2/9 = 7.77` -> round to 8. So, (2,8) is '1'.\n    -   For row 3: `col = 8 - 3/9 = 7.67` -> round to 8. So, (3,8) is '1'.\n    -   For row 4: `col = 8 - 4/9 = 7.56` -> round to 8. So, (4,8) is '1'.\n    -   For row 5: `col = 8 - 5/9 = 7.44` -> round to 7. So, (5,7) is '1'. (Shift occurs here)\n    -   For row 6: `col = 8 - 6/9 = 7.33` -> round to 7. So, (6,7) is '1'.\n    -   For row 7: `col = 8 - 7/9 = 7.22` -> round to 7. So, (7,7) is '1'.\n4.  **Load Distribution:** The strut ends at (7,7). This load needs to be distributed to the three support points S(9,6), S(9,7), S(9,8). We place material directly above them in row 8: (8,6), (8,7), (8,8) become '1'.\n    -   Cell (7,7) transfers its load to (8,6), (8,7), and (8,8). This is achieved by direct vertical connection from (7,7) to (8,7) and diagonal connections from (7,7) to (8,6) and (7,7) to (8,8).\n5.  **Minimizing Material:** This \"dogbone\" structure (wide ends, narrow middle) uses significantly less material (12 filled 'V' cells) than a solid 3-cell wide beam (24 filled 'V' cells) while maintaining a plausible load path. Such shapes are common in topology optimization where material reduction is a key objective.\n\nFilled 'V' cells:\n-   Row 1: (1,7), (1,8), (1,9)\n-   Row 2: (2,8)\n-   Row 3: (3,8)\n-   Row 4: (4,8)\n-   Row 5: (5,7)\n-   Row 6: (6,7)\n-   Row 7: (7,7)\n-   Row 8: (8,6), (8,7), (8,8)\n\nAll other 'V' cells will be '0'.\n\nCompleted Grid Construction:\n\nRow 0: (Unchanged)\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 L L L`\n\nRow 1: (Fill (1,7), (1,8), (1,9) with '1', others '0')\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1`\n\nRow 2: (Fill (2,8) with '1', others '0')\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0`\n\nRow 3: (Fill (3,8) with '1', others '0')\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0`\n\nRow 4: (Fill (4,8) with '1', others '0')\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0`\n\nRow 5: (Fill (5,7) with '1', others '0')\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0`\n\nRow 6: (Fill (6,7) with '1', others '0')\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0`\n\nRow 7: (Fill (7,7) with '1', others '0')\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0`\n\nRow 8: (Fill (8,6), (8,7), (8,8) with '1', others '0')\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0`\n\nRow 9: (Unchanged)\n`0 0 0 0 0 0 S S S 0`\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 L L L\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 S S S 0",

    "prompt": "You are given a structural material distribution represented as a grid. Each cell can have one of the following states:\n- 'L' indicates applied load.\n- 'V' indicates void.\n- 'S' indicates support.\n\nThe goal is to predict the correct material distribution by filling in all 'V' cells with either '1' (solid) or '0' (empty), based on the surrounding structure and implicit physical reasoning (such as load paths, supports, and forces).\n\nImportant: The completed structure should use as little material as possible while remaining stable and plausible for carrying the applied forces.
