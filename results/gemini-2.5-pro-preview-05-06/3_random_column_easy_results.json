We will assume load transfer occurs between cardinally adjacent cells (sharing an edge).\n\nInput grid:\n0 0 L L V V L 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 V V 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 V V 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 V V 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 V V 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 V V 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 V V 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 V V 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 V V 0 0 0 0\n0 0 S S V V 0 0 0 0\n\nLoads: L(0,2), L(0,3), L(0,6)\nSupports: S(9,2), S(9,3)\nExisting material relevant to V-columns: M(1,3)=1, M(2,3)=1\n\nAnalysis of load paths:\n\n1.  **Load L(0,3) [and L(0,2)]**:\n    *   L(0,3) is supported by M(1,3). L(0,2) is adjacent to L(0,3) and can share its load path.\n    *   M(1,3)=1 is supported by M(2,3)=1.\n    *   M(2,3)=1 must transfer its load. Since M(3,3)=0, the load must go horizontally to V(2,4). So, V(2,4) must be '1'.\n    *   Once the load is at M(2,4), it needs a path down to the supports. This implies a column: M(3,4)=1, M(4,4)=1, ..., M(8,4)=1, M(9,4)=1.\n    *   M(9,4)=1 is adjacent to S(9,3), providing connection to the support. S(9,2) is also available as S(9,2)-S(9,3) are connected.\n    *   This establishes a primary load-bearing column in cells (2,4) through (9,4). This requires 8 'V' cells to become '1'.\n\n2.  **Load L(0,6)**:\n    *   L(0,6) must be supported by an adjacent material cell. M(1,6)=0 and M(0,7)=0. So, V(0,5) must be '1'.\n    *   Now M(0,5)=1 needs support.\n        *   It can be supported by V(0,4) (horizontally) or V(1,5) (vertically).\n        *   Let's choose to transfer load towards the established column 4. So, M(0,5)=1 is supported by V(0,4)=1.\n        *   Now M(0,4)=1 needs support. It's supported by V(1,4)=1.\n        *   M(1,4)=1 needs support. It's supported by M(2,4)=1 (which is already part of the primary column from step 1).\n    *   This path for L(0,6) is: L(0,6) -> M(0,5)=1 -> M(0,4)=1 -> M(1,4)=1 -> M(2,4)=1.\n    *   This adds 3 more '1's: V(0,5)=1, V(0,4)=1, V(1,4)=1.\n\nCombining these, the 'V' cells to be filled with '1' are:\n*   From L(0,3) path: (2,4), (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), (8,4), (9,4). (8 cells)\n*   From L(0,6) path: (0,5), (0,4), (1,4). (3 cells)\nTotal '1's = 11. All other 'V's will be '0'.\n\nThis configuration creates a continuous column of material in column 4 from row 0 to row 9.\n*   (0,4)=1, (1,4)=1, (2,4)=1, ..., (9,4)=1.\n*   (0,5)=1 to connect L(0,6) to this column via (0,4).\n*   All other 'V' cells in column 5: (1,5) through (9,5) will be '0'.\n\nLet's write the resulting grid:\nRow 0: V(0,4)=1, V(0,5)=1\nRow 1: V(1,4)=1, V(1,5)=0\nRow 2: V(2,4)=1, V(2,5)=0\n...\nRow 9: V(9,4)=1, V(9,5)=0\n\nCompleted grid:\n0 0 L L 1 1 L 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 S S 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis structure uses minimal material while ensuring all loads are cardinally connected to supports and seems stable and plausible.\n\n0 0 L L 1 1 L 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 S S 1 0 0 0 0 0",
